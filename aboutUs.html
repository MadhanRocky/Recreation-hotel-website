                      The service at the Hotel Monteleone was exceptional. There was
                      absolutely no issue that was not addressed timely and with
                      satisfactory results. We were particulary impressed with how the
                      hotel staff anticipated our needs (periodically coming by the
                      Board Room to check with us)
